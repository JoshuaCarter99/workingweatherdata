# Working Weather Data

## Description

- My motivation towards completing this project was in wanting to utilize an API to its fullest extent in order to display relevant data.
- I built this project to display what I have learned about APIs and using JavaScript to display cloud-stored data.
- The problem solved within the challenge was building a functioning 5 day forecase (for any city) while also showing the current weather conditions.
- I learned how to build a functional app that utilized API data access and utilization.

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

1. Created repository on GitHub.com and cloned repository locally to desktop.
2. Created index.html and created script for the entirety of HTML first to make sure all labels and general format were in check before working on JS.
3. Created script.js and made sure it was able to interact with HTML properly.
4. Ensured all links to fonts, bootstrap, API etc. were functional with code.
5. Created style.css and worked on CSS last to ensure webpage looked semi-appealing.
6. Pushed local changes back to main branch on original GitHub repository (via GitHub.com), and deployed code at live URL.


## Usage

Open the provided URL on your desired browser to access the Weather Data app. Type in (just about) any city across the globe to see current weather data and 5 day forecast data.
